## JS Project Proposal: Synth-pal

### Background

Synth-pal is a browser-based keyboard synthesizer featuring eight keys with different pitches, an oscillator, and filter control to enable sound modification. User's will be able to control the notes of the sound through the following inputs: "A", "W", "S", "E", "D", "R", "F", "T"

### Functionality & MVP

With Synth-pal, users will be able to:
- [ ] Play sounds on the visual keyboard through their computer keyboards
- [ ] Oscillates sounds using the oscillator
- [ ] Modify sounds using the filter
- [ ] Change volume of the sounds through the UI

In addition, this project will include:
- [ ] An About modal with instructions on how to use the synth
- [ ] A production README

### Wireframes
This app will consist of a single screen with a visual keyboard, oscillator and filter controls, as well as volume nob. It will also include nav links to the GitHub, my LinkedIn, and the About Modal.
